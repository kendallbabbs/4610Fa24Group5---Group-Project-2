<h2>Data Set Description:</h2>
<p>The dataset contains detailed records of traffic crashes within the city limits of Chicago under the jurisdiction of the Chicago Police Department(CPD). This dataset covers crash data from select police districts starting in 2015, expanded citywide through 2017 and on. This is a large dataset, including both minor and major crashes recorded by CPD. There are numerous columns within the dataset, but we selected a few key columns to focus on. This includes crash type (categorical), primary contributory cause (categorical), injuries total (numerical), report type (categorical), weather (categorical), crash hour (numerical).</p>


<h2>Our 2 Questions:</h2>

<h3>1. Which specific type of crashes provokes the most injuries, both in total and on a per crash basis?</h3>
<p>This question is important in identifying what kinds of crashes have a high possibility of injury and more specifically which crashes have the most injuries, aka crashes that are the most dangerous. Knowing these crash types can help policy makers and authorities to make informed decisions on traffic safety and focus on mitigating these specific crashes. Additionally, identifying these collisions can enable educational campaigns and technological innovations aimed at reducing the particular risks associated with these crashes. Overall, this question highlights areas where action is needed, and encourages the city of Chicago to take the preventative measures against crashes.</p>


<h3>2. What external factors contribute to a higher injury rating for pedestrian injuries?</h3>
<p>This question is helpful in explaining why pedestrian crashes are more injury-prone, shedding light on contributing factors such as lack of driver wellness or pedestrian visibility. Analyzing external factors (e.g. weather conditions, lighting, vehicle speed, or road design) can help us understand what preventative measures to take, like improving the safety of crosswalks, more speed regulation, and even better monitoring the state of drivers. This understanding can lead to awareness campaigns targeting both drivers and pedestrians, promoting behaviors that reduce injury risks and improve the safety of driving. All in all, visualizing this question can contribute to safer roads, informed policymaking, and ultimately save lives by reducing the severity of traffic incidents.</p>
